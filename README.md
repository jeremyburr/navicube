# PsyBurr-Redux 

This is an abandoned legacy implementation of my personal website - psyburr.com. It uses the react-redux bindings to manage application state across sections. It compiles and works as expected, but its UI is unfinished. 

It includes redux-thunk, redux-promise, redux-logger, and Radium to dispatch asynchronous actions, manage inline styles, and debug. The 3D cube is built with CSS3 transforms.

It eventually became clear to me that using Redux to manage this single-page application's state was overkill, and actually hindering my ability to fully grasp vanilla React. So, I'm taking a step back. I look forward using Redux again in the future - whatever project that may be.
