# PsyBurr-Redux 

Abandoned legacy implementation of psyburr.com.  It used react-redux bindings. Works as expected, but UI is unfinished. It includes redux-thunk, redux-promise, redux-logger, and Radium to dispatch asynchronous actions, manage inline styles, and debug. While never completed, it's worth archiving.
