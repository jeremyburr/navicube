# PsyBurr-Redux 

This is an abandoned legacy implementation of my personal website - psyburr.com. It uses the react-redux bindings to manage application state across sections. It compiles and works as expected, but its UI is unfinished. 

It includes redux-thunk, redux-promise, redux-logger, and Radium to dispatch asynchronous actions, manage inline styles, and debug. The 3D cube is built with CSS3 transforms.
