It includes redux-thunk, redux-promise, redux-logger, redux-bootstrap, and Radium to dispatch asynchronous actions, add mobile responsiveness, manage inline styles, and debug. The browser console is configured to print state action objects using the logger. CSS3 transforms is used to build a 3D cube and bring it to life. Webpack is also used.
