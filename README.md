# PsyBurr-Redux 

This is an abandoned legacy implementation of my personal website - psyburr.com.  It uses the react-redux bindings to manage application state across sections. I eventually concluded that using Redux was overkill for this task, and possibly hindering my ability to fully understand React. So, I took a step back. I look forward using Redux again in the future - on whatever project that may be.  

At time of writing, it compiles and works as expected, but its UI is unfinished. It includes redux-thunk, redux-promise, redux-logger, and Radium to dispatch asynchronous actions, manage inline styles, and debug. The 3D cube is built with CSS3 transforms. Left unfinished, it's not an ideal example of clean refactored code. However, I think the way it uses Redux to manage state is more or less sound, and therefore worth archiving.
