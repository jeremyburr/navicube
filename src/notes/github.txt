Vulkern 

Vulkern is a physical command interface system. It allows a user to operate a computer with body movement. It creates a real-time kinesthetic feedback loop between the user and computer. It includes an input device suit, microcontrollers, drivers, command-line tools, GUI application, and physical command language.  

Input Device: A number of approaches - both wired and wireless - are being considered. Use of gyroscopes, accelerometers, and magnets will be explored, as will merging applicable developments the emerging area of virtual reality suits

Kidelix 

Kidelix is an intuitive vector 3D modeling framework. It integrates a set of mathematical principles, including crystal lattice systems, L-system fractals, the golden ratio, electron orbital structure, electromagnetic waves, kaleidoscopes, and cellular automatons.

Its core library will start with three categories: human anatomy, plant life, and architecture.	Kidelix's interactive mode allows body movement control with Vulkern.	
							
Veagrow 

Veagrow is an automated plant growth system. Its interchangeable units of tube and wiring mappings allow for easy scaling and customization. Solar powered options will be explored. 	

Xelenix 

Xelenix is an interactive virtual space showcasing models developed with Kidelix. A world of fantasy, Xelenix is as much a feat of art as it is programing.    

Psilogenix 

Psilogenix is an experimental visual pattern generator developed with Kidelix. It draws influence heavily from psychedic art.

that uses redux-thunk, redux-promise, redux-logger, redux-bootstrap, and Radium to dispatch asynchronous actions, add mobile responsiveness, manage inline styles, and debug. CSS3 is used to build a 3D cube and bring it to life.
